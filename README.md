# LEGO Powered UP Application

Check out [the server](https://github.com/Nickzster/lego-poweredup-app-server) portion of the app to see more in-depth details.

- The client is a basic create-react-app that uses a websocket connection to send commands to the server.
- The server will send the entire state of the _Remotes_ and _Motors_, and render virtual controllers, as well as buttons to change the operation of the LEGO hardware.
